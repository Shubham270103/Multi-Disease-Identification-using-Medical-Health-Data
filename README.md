## Project Description

The project focuses on creating a robust deep learning model that can analyze various types of medical health data, such as images, lab results, and patient records, to identify a range of diseases accurately. The model is trained on a diverse and representative dataset to ensure its generalization to real-world scenarios.

## Key Features

- Multi-disease identification using deep learning techniques
- Customizable architecture for different disease categories
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines
- Performance evaluation using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Collaboration with medical experts for model validation

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-disease-identification.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd multi-disease-identification`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Prepare your medical health dataset following the guidelines in the `Data` section.
2. Preprocess and augment the data using the provided scripts in the `data_preprocessing` directory.
3. Configure the model architecture and hyperparameters in the `model_config.py` file.
4. Train the deep learning model using the training scripts in the `train` directory.
5. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using the evaluation scripts.

## Data

The dataset used for this project consists of a diverse collection of medical health data, including images, lab results, and patient records. Due to privacy concerns, we cannot provide the original dataset. However, guidelines for preparing and formatting your own dataset can be found in the `data_preprocessing` directory.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model is designed using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The architecture is customized for multi-disease identification and is implemented in the `model.py` file. Detailed documentation on the model's architecture and layers can be found in the `docs` directory.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A detailed summary of the evaluation results, along with visualizations, can be found in the `results` directory. For a more comprehensive analysis, refer to the project's wiki.
